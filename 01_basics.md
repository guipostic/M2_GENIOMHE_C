# Main function
In C programming, it is necessary to have a `main` function.
The `main` function serves as the entry point for a C program.
When you run a C program, the operating system starts executing code from the `main` function.
Without a `main` function, the program would not have a starting point, and it would not be able to execute.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

# Preprocessor directive
`#include` is a preprocessor directive in C.
It is used to include the contents of a standard or user-defined header file in your C program.
In this case, `<stdio.h>` is a standard header file that stands for "standard input-output header."
It provides functions and definitions for input and output operations.
By including `<stdio.h>`, you gain access to the `printf` function and other I/O related features.

# Output display
`printf` is a standard C library function used for formatted output.
It is responsible for displaying text or data on the console or other output devices.
In this line, `printf` is used to print the string "Hello, world!" followed by a newline character (`\n`) to the standard output (usually the console).

# Return statement
`return` is a keyword in C used to specify the return value of a function.
In this case, it's used in the `main` function to indicate that the program has executed without any errors and is returning an exit status of 0.
In C and many other programming languages, a return value of 0 typically indicates success, while a non-zero value can be used to indicate different error conditions.
