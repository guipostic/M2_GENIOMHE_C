# M2_GENIOMHE_C
CM et TD de programmation C pour le Master 2 GENIOMHE

## Summary
This course will teach you the basics of the C programming language.
The source code provided here is compliant with the C11 standard. Its compilation has been tested with the GNU C Compiler (gcc) 7.5.0, on Ubuntu 18.05 operating system.  
  
**As an exercise**, you will implement a singly linked list (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), with functions to add or remove nodes, and to print the list. This will require the following concepts:
* functions
* loops
* C struct
* pointers
* dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)

Optionally, additional functions can be implemented (e.g. to reverse or sort the linked list), as well as other types of linked lists (e.g. circular or doubly linked lists).  

*Following this course, you will be introduced to the concepts of parallel programming in C (teacher: Patrice LUCAS).*
