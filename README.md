# M2_GENIOMHE_C
CM et TD de [programmation C pour le Master 2 GENIOMHE](https://github.com/guipostic/M2_GENIOMHE_C)

## Summary
This course will teach you the basics of the C programming language.  
The source code provided here is compliant with the C11 standard.  
Its compilation has been tested with the GNU C Compiler (gcc) 7.5.0, on Ubuntu 18.05 operating system.  
  
**As an exercise**, you will implement a singly [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), with functions to add or remove nodes, and to print the list.  
This will require knowledge of:
* functions
* loops
* C struct
* pointers
* dynamic memory allocation ([malloc, free](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/))

Optionally, additional functions can be implemented (e.g. to reverse or sort the linked list), as well as other types of linked lists (e.g. circular or doubly linked lists).  

*Following this course, you will be introduced to the concepts of parallel programming in C (teacher: Patrice LUCAS).*
